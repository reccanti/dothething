# dothething

`dothething` is a collection of CLI tools and scripts that I use for various tasks. You can use one like so:

```bash
dothething <tool> [options...] 
```

## Current Tools

### mkgif

`mkgif` uses `ffmpeg` to convert video files into gifs. I like to use it to make screencaptures for GitHub pull requests alongside the MacOS `cmd+shift+5` tool. Run `dothething mkgif --help` to see what options it accepts!

_NOTE: This requires you to have `ffmpeg` installed on your computer!!!_

# Ideas for future tools

* [ ] See all "linked" npm dependencies in a package and unlink them
* [ ] Check the required peer-dependencies of a package and see if there are any that are not installed
